# Token Gating Javascript for Metamask / web3.js

## Intro
Token gating is a way for projects to limit access to certain benefits based on who holds an NFT or has a certain amount of traditional fungible tokens. These tokens, either NFTs or traditional fungible tokens, serve as proof of ownership and are shown via a crypto wallet such as MetaMask. To gain access to token gated benefits, you typically need to connect or sign a message with your crypto wallet, proving ownership of a certain NFT or a certain amount of traditional fungible tokens. Once you complete this step, it’s easy to claim whatever benefit is being offered.

Are you a business looking to enhance your community engagement, loyalty program or rewards system? Token gating using Award Pool is a powerful tool that can help you create value for your community members. By offering token gated benefits such as exclusive content, events, and other perks, you can incentivize your community members to hold on to your NFTs. This can help increase the value of your NFTs and create a loyal community.

### How Does Token Gating Work?
Getting access to token gated benefits is typically a simple process. Usually projects require you to connect or sign a message with your crypto wallet, proving ownership of a certain NFT. Once you complete this step, it’s easy to claim whatever benefit is being offered.

### Why Do NFT Projects Use Token Gating?
NFT projects use token gating for a variety of reasons. The overarching purpose is to create value for their NFT holders. Token gating assists with distributing exclusive content, event tickets, airdrops, and merchandise.


## ERC20_TokenGate.js
This code is used to connect to the Ethereum network and retrieve the user's balance. It uses the web3.js library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and MetaMask as the provider. 

The first step is to define a web3 provider. We use either MetaMask or the current provider, depending on which is available.

Next, we define the user's wallet address, the contract address and the contract ABI (Application Binary Interface). The ABI is used to create an instance of the contract. 

Once the contract is created, we call the balanceOf function to get the user's balance. This function may return either a balance in wei (the native currency of the Ethereum network) or a balance in the token of the contract, depending on the contract's address being empty or not.

Finally, we define a threshold and check if the user's balance is greater or less than the threshold. If the contract address is not empty, the balance will be in token and if the contract address is empty, the balance will be in wei.

## NFT_TokenGate.js
This script is used to interact with an Ethereum-based Non-Fungible Token (NFT) contract. It uses the Web3 JavaScript library to connect to the Ethereum network and the contract's ABI (interface) to interact with the contract.

The first part of the script is connecting to the Ethereum network through the MetaMask provider. This is done using the Web3 library.

The next step is to define the contract address and the user's wallet address so that the script knows which wallet to check and which contract to interact with.

The ABI (application binary interface) is then defined so that the script knows how to interact with the contract. The ABI is an array of objects that contains the functions and arguments of the contract.

The contract object is then created using the Web3 library, which takes the ABI and contract address as arguments.

The balanceOf function is called to get the balance of the user's wallet. This function takes an address as an argument and returns the balance of the wallet in the form of a number.

The next step is to iterate through the range of token IDs from startId to endId. For each tokenId
