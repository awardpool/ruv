AES-256-CBC is an encryption algorithm used to secure data. It stands for Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key in Cipher Block Chaining mode. It is important because it is a strong encryption algorithm that is used to protect sensitive data, including financial information and online transactions. AES-256-CBC is used by many organizations to protect their data, and is considered to be one of the most secure encryption algorithms available.

This code creates two functions, getResponseType() and getStatusCode(), to get the type of response and the status code for a request. The code also creates two async functions, encrypt() and decrypt(), for encrypting and decrypting data using the crypto module. Lastly, the code creates the handleRequest() function to handle the request, which checks the request's method. If it is a POST request, the function will grab the body of the request, encrypt the data, and then decrypt the data before returning a response. If the request is not a POST request, an error response is returned. The code also creates an event listener to call the handleRequest() function when a fetch event is triggered.
